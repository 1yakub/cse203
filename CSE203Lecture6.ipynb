        "So, a stack when represented as a linked list can be thought of having two operations adding an element at the back and then removing an element from the back. Think of the stack of plates in the kitchen sink but horizontally. You put a plate on top of the stack, you can also say that you put a plate in the back, if you think horizonatally. Afterwards you can also say that you take a plate from top of the stack or take a plate from the back in the horizontal fashion. So, in a linked list terminology, it is adding an element back, and then removing an element from the back. Let us implement it for a stack.\n"
