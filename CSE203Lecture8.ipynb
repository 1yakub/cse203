        "\n",
        "In singly linked list , we managed to solve one problem that arrays had. It is the problem of extra space. However, at the same time, we also introduced another problem in the mix, the search time of an element in a linked list in the worst case is O(n). It means that to find an element, in the worst case, one has to search `n` number of elements to find the number that he/she is looking for. Is there something that can be done better than O(n), at the same time keeping the flexibility. Enter Binary Search Tree, where searching can done much faster, without sacrificing much space for insertion or deletion. In a binary search tree the node which are larger than the parent node are kept on the right side of the tree. The nodes which are smaller than the parent node are kept on the left side of the tree. What is a tree, you may ask ... it is a way of representing data in a inverted tree shape.\n",
