        "Doubly Linked List is just an extension of singly linked list. If you know how singly linked list works, you already know 90% of doubly linked list.\n",
        "\n",
        "So the difference between doubly linked list and a singly linked list is the way doubly linked list is defined. Doubly Linked List(DLL for short) has an extra node adress to point to the node previous to it. Sometime that previous node is present and sometimes there are no nodes infront of it. However, the other address denotes the address of the node next to it,similar to that of singly linked list. Let us see the implementation of the different functions to get a better feel of the implmentation of doubly linked list."

When the value `45` was removed every one of them was removed, however when `4` was removed only one value of `4` was removed. Let me see whether you can fix the bug."
