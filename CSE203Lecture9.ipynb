        "So, as you have seen in the previous lecture on binary search trees each parent has 0 to 2 child/children(left and right node). What if we want to accommodate more that 2 children, enter graph. Here a single parent can have 0 to n number of child/chidren. In real life, this situation simulates scenarios such as road connection between cities, chemical bonds between elements, internet connections between different nodes.\n",

If there is no connection between two node, a `0` is used to denote the relationship. Below is a representation of it:\n",

In the case of 2d matrix arrays, access time of checking relationship betwee two nodes is very fast, however, there are lots of realtionships which are denoted by 0. On the other hand if a linked list representation has been used, there would not be such wastage of bit to store useless relationship, but the traversal time of a linked in in the order of O(n).\n",
