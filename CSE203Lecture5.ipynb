        "So linked list is a data structure which is designed to alleviate one of the weakest point of array data structure, it is inability to insert/remove an element without copying the orginal array again.It leads to wastage of space. So, computer scientist have designed linked list to cause minimal space wastage, even then there is considerable amount of code complexity as well as time complexity involved. Anyhow in the code blocks below, there is a step by step process in which linked list are developed. Hopefully, you will find it useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in linked list is a list of numbers which are connected by means of links or in this case pointers. Theses pointers contains adddresses of the next number in the link. Formally, a linked list is a list of nodes, and each node contain the address of the next node in the list. If any number is required to be removed from the list, a node containing the number is removed from the list. There is no necessity of adding extra space for this removal. On the comtrary if a number is required to be added to a particular place in the list, no extra space is required for that either. A for loop or while loop is used to find the relevant place for that node containing that number.\n"

In the above example when we removed elements we removed one single element from a list, it fails to remove duplicate elements from a list if there is a duplicate number of times in the list. Try adding multiple number of '2's infront of the list and then delete them. Only one '2' will be removed, but try adding any other elements mulitple time e.g '8', all instances of that element will be removed, if that said element is decided for removal.
